## Search Rotate Array ##

In this problem we are using the sorted values and the condition of no duplicate in our favor. So we have to 2 methods but both have the same principle of binary search tree. Becuase I wanna optimaze the search, I have one method for sorted arrays that contains the pivot and we don't exactly where is located and there other method is for a sorted array with no pivot on it.

The time complexity is equals to the binary search, so it is O(log(n)).
The space complexity is O(1), because we don't require to store any values.
