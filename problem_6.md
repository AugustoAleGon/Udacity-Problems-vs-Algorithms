## Unsorted Integer Array ##

We decided to go for the most straight forward solution. Because we are looking for the minimum and the maximum number and we don't have to sort any array. So we just traverse once the array and we look for the minimum and maximum value.

The time complexity is O(n) and n is the lenght of the array.
The space complexity is O(1) because we just use two variables to store the minimum and the maximum value.
