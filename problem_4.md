## Dutch National Flag Problem ##

Because we know the data that the input array has, we are gonna sort the array using that in out favor. The data is three types of intergers 0, 1 and 2. So we just put the zeros on the left, if the element is 2 put at it the end and just skip is the element is 1.

The time complexity is O(n).
The space complexity is O(1), because we are sorting in the same array.
